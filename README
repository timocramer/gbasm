gbasm is an assembler for the Z80-like GameBoy.

  "gbasm - it's like orgasm" #YourDailyHauer

I liked the GameBoy and always wanted to make a game for it, but it was also an
interesting idea to write the assembler itself. This is the second try (all I
wanted was beginning with Bison) and it finally works!

If you want to install it under Arch Linux, you only need the PKGBUILD, which
loads the code then.
